INTRODUCTION

The National Democratic Congress (NDC) remains deeply committed to  principles   values of Social Democracy.
As Social Democrats, we subscribe to a compassionate political philosophy that seeks to create opportunities    all to develop to their fullest potential. We believe that our pursuit of economic prosperity    all Ghanaians can best be achieved through appropriate regulation   strategic investments. We      therefore committed to using  legal, fiscal   trade instruments at our disposal, in an inclusive effort to safeguard  jobs of today   create  jobs of  future.

In our quest to build a sustainable society with opportunities    all, we will continue to prioritize education   skills training as  cornerstone to progress. We rededicate ourselves to  expansion of economic freedom   opportunity by providing incentives    small businesses to grow, by encouraging local community development   building  environment    domestic manufacturing to support job creation.

The National Democratic Congress (NDC) is committed to building a just   equitable society in which citizens      empowered to seize on opportunities to improve themselves. We believe that we can achieve more together than individually, hence our policies   programs      designed to make each one as empowered   productive as he or she can be.
Ours is an approach anchored in  fact that Ghana's human resources      our nation's most valuable assets. This explains why over  years our development priorities are: (a) putting people first, (b) building a strong   resilient economy, (c) providing reliable infrastructure,   (d) improving accountability in governance. We believe we have succeeded in creating a better foundation    safe   secure conditions    national progress.

Ours is an approach anchored in  fact that Ghana's human resources      our nation's most valuable assets.

Putting People First is  expression of our relentless effort to invest in sectors of our society with  view of empowering our people through better educational systems   opportunities; providing reliable   dependable healthcare arrangements; ensuring inclusiveness by protecting  most vulnerable in our society, thus creating reliable pathways    our youth to achieve their aspirations.
Our approach to "Putting People First" involves overarching concerns with redistribution, production, reproduction   protection;   synchronizes with our economic policy objectives in  pursuit of economic growth   social progress. We have verifiable achievements in education, healthcare, social protection, gender empowerment   equality, youth development   sporting opportunities as manifestations of our commitment.

Strong   Resilient Economy represents our desire to build an economy that provides a channel    human creativity that meets  aspirations of Ghanaians to work. It is an illustration of our commitment to build an economy that nurtures   protects  young,  old    vulnerable; an economy that is capable of dealing with major adversities such as climate change, while at  same time enhancing life    our people. As Social Democrats, we believe that economic growth is important, however, growth alone is not enough to deliver jobs   fair incomes.

Our commitment to build a strong   resilient economy therefore, is one that prioritizes decent   productive work    our people as a means of brightening  prospects    poverty reduction   personal development. It is precisely because of this belief that we have actively incentivized various industries in  private sector not only to encourage  production of made in Ghana goods, but also to enlarge employment opportunities. To this end, beyond  continuous focus on maintaining prudent monetary   fiscal policies to attract investment, we will also continue to invest heavily in agriculture, manufacturing   mining to provide support to  private sector.

Expanding Infrastructure is core to realizing economic growth   boosting opportunities    job creation. Our view is that in diverse ways a good infrastructure system       a positive impact on productivity.    instance, improved roads facilitate private investment, improves access to markets    farmers by reducing transport costs, thus stabilizing jobs   income levels.  extension of electricity to poor households contributes to lower energy bills that support  expansion of cottage industries. Electricity is also critical    improved communication. Clean or potable water       immense health benefits that contribute to  well-being of all, especially children.

In pursuit of our transformational agenda, we have prioritized infrastructural expansion across several sectors including roads, water supply systems, energy, transport   housing. It is an important economic incentive    both public   private operations.

As Social Democrats we view Infrastructural development as a means to enhance productivity, transportation   communication.

Transparent   Accountable Governance reflects our commitment to working to attain a society that encourages citizen participation in affairs of  State. It is our belief that Governments that derive their mandate      people must not only work      with  people, but must also be open   accountable to  people. Our pursuit of transparent governance       opened up considerable space    Civil Society Organizations   Ghanaians to actively engage in  policy debate, formulation   implementation processes.

We belief that through participation we can, as a society   consistent with  norms of democracy, achieve  best political outcomes that reflect  broad judgment of our people.

We remain committed to building a peaceful, safe   inclusive society that respects  diversities of our nation. We will not renege on
our commitment to continuously promote  rule of law,  fight against corruption   graft, tolerance, pluralism, national security   cohesion. In our view, public service imposes an obligation to work in  interest our country. This is  reason    our quest to use innovation   creativity to make public services responsive to  needs of  people     whom we derive our mandate.

In  last four years, we have pursued  pledge we made to Ghanaians, as anchored on  four pillars of our 2012 Manifesto. We have achieved significant infrastructural development providing health facilities, educational opportunities, access to potable water, investments in energy, expansion in telecommunications, transportation   housing. We have thus set in motion  process of 'Changing Lives   Transforming Ghana'.

As a party, we seek a renewal of  mandate      people to enable us extend our transformation agenda. This document provides a record of our delivery   our commitment to  people of Ghana    a second term    President John Dramani Mahama.

THEME TWO

STRONG ECONOMY    JOBS & TRANSFORMATION

Ghana's economy       seen steady progress over  past few decades   investor confidence continues to improve with  attainment of Lower Middle Income Country (LMIC) status.  average GDP growth rate over  seven-year period spanning 2009 to 2015 is 6.8% per annum compared to 5.8% per annum     2001 to 2008   4.4% between 1993   1999. Macroeconomic stability remains key to  attainment of accelerated growth   development. With prudent   effective management of  economy, we have seen sustained growth over  last few years despite  challenging context of global economic volatilities (precipitous fall in commodity prices)   an economy in transition with attendant dwindling concessional financing   increasing cost of credit.

THE ECONOMY

OUR ACHIEVEMENTS

In 2014, our "home grown solutions" fortified by  consensus we reached at Senchi, led to  development of a domestic agenda    growth   development that was used as  basis    initiating discussion with  International Monetary Fund    an External Credit Facility (ECF) Programme.
After two years of implementation,  ECF is contributing to  reversal of adverse movements   allowing macro-economic indicators to resume positive trends. Economic growth is on  rise,  rate of inflation is moving downward,  exchange rate is stable,   even appreciating as a result of a reducing budget deficit. Improvements in  balance of payments have contributed to increase in  level of reserves.We commit to sustaining  reforms that have turned our fortunes around   confirmed  potential of our economy. We also commit to implementing  Economic Transformation   Livelihood Empowerment Programme (ETLEP) to create more jobs     citizenry    enhanced incomes.
Investor confidence       been high, attested to by  fact that global companies continue to invest in our economy. Ghana attracted US $9.7 billion in Foreign Direct Investment between 2013   2015. Work commenced on  US$7 billion Sankofa hydrocarbon project, which  World Bank guaranteed with US $700 million.
Our vision of a strong   resilient economy is that it must lead to increased value addition   job creation. This informed our investment in domestic raw material based industries, such as  Komenda Sugar Factory,  Kumasi Shoe Factory,  Ghana Gas Processing Plant at Atuabo    Ceramic Factory that will produce 40 million square metres of tiles annually     local   export markets, at Eshiem in  Western Region.

Arising out of our commitment to build strong institutions as an anchor in  Transformation Agenda,  following have been achieved:

*  Ghana Infrastructure Investment Fund (GIIF), which will be at  forefront of addressing our infrastructure deficit   accelerating growth,       been established;

*  Export Trade Agricultural   Industrial Development Fund (EDAIF) was strengthened to give more financing supporting to local industries;
*  Export   Import Bank of Ghana       been established.

OUR COMMITMENT (2017-2021)

MACROECONOMIC POLICIES, STRATEGIES   TARGETS

Since  attainment of  Lower Middle Income Country status in 2011    subsequent reclassification of Ghana's international profile,  need to change economic management strategy       become crucial, especially in  country's financing arrangements.
Grants, which had hitherto played a significant role in  country's financing choices, have virtually ceased on  attainment of  LMIC status. In spite of this, growth performance       been encouraging    economy       remained relatively stable with  implementation of our economic programme.

GIHOC distilleries

Spurred on by  successful economic performance in recent years   mindful of  fact that Ghana is a LMIC,  next four years will be underpinned by continued pursuit of prudent economic policies aimed at further creation of employment opportunities, enhanced incomes   growth with macroeconomic stability.
With economic growth spurring strong employment creation, macroeconomic policies will emphasize domestic demand policies to safeguard macroeconomic stability   keep inflation in single digits.
Towards this end, a strong focus will also be on increased agricultural production, especially food crops.  evidence shows that inflation is massively influenced by  food crops   fisheries component of  Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket.
To ensure that food crops   fisheries sector do not impact negatively on inflation, a better congenial framework will be provided     public   private sector to drive  modernization of  agricultural sector. It is expected that this modernization of agriculture will feed into  macroeconomic management process while macroeconomic stability will, in turn, enhance private sector competitive agricultural production.

Ghana's status as an oil exporting country requires that we improve agriculture in order to avoid  Dutch disease. It is our commitment to maintain a vibrant agricultural sector such that developments in oil   gas production do not engender a loss of competitiveness of  agricultural sector.This is important    us because agriculture remains  primary livelihood     majority of our population, especially in rural communities. Sustained investments in agricultural expansion through commercialization    adoption of modern technologies will help create job opportunities     poor   fight an increasingly adverse climate.
Similarly, exchange rate policies will be anchored in promoting exports   private sector competitiveness.  private sector is envisioned to partner  public sector in  production   delivery of infrastructure facilities.  NDC as a social democratic party with strong conviction    active state participation in  delivery of public goods   other meritorious social goods, will continue to promote partnerships with  private sector in  production of these goods   services.
The NDC envisages that  private sector will take a leading role in  diversification of exports   expand access to both international   domestic markets with import substitution, thus improving foreign exchange earnings of government   providing relative stability in  foreign exchange market.
Having reined in  fiscal excesses that characterised election years, prudence in public expenditures will continue to be a top priority to ensure  fiscal   macroeconomic stability of  country. We will rationalize  fiscal space, especially  tariff regimes to ensure that taxation   other tariffs      instruments of industrial development   trade facilitation so that, supported by government,  private sector can become  engine of employment creation, enhanced incomes, growth   wealth creation.
The revenues accrued will be used to leverage private sector investments. In order to optimise  use of tariffs   other taxes, both as revenue generation   trade facilitation instruments,   to promote industrial development, Government       established  Ghana International Trade Commission (GITC) with  mandate, inter alia, to:

* Monitor   review  pattern of Ghana's international trade   advise on matters affecting trade   industry;

* Study, identify   recommend tariff levels    specific sectors of  economy with due regard to  effective rate of protection without  blanket removal of duties on all imports and

* Conduct studies   publish reports on  competitiveness of Ghana's tariff structure    impact of  tariff structure on domestic industry, market access opportunities   challenges in relation to exports     Ghana;
With improved private sector competitiveness (as a result of rationalized tariff regimes    growth   stronger taxable income) revenues will increase to reduce  fiscal deficits   also reduce dependence on debt. It is expected that  associated improved revenues   reduced monetization of fiscal deficits, interest rates on private sector loans will fall   make credit more accessible at competitive rates.
Germane to  fiscal rationalization    macroeconomic stability is  debt management objective to source funds to meet public financing needs   payment obligations at  minimum competitive cost   prudent level of risk, as well as to ensure that public debts      maintained at sustainable levels into  longer term.
The NDC Government will work to ensure that  fiscals do not pose problems    debt management, especially as outlined in our Medium Term Debt Strategy (MTDS), which focuses on managing  risk exposure associated with  existing debt portfolio   taking  necessary   prudent steps to mitigate  potential risk that would be embedded in current   future borrowing. With improved sovereign rating of Ghana,  private sector can borrow internationally at lower rates to invest   promote job creation.
Consequently,  continued transformation will entail:

* Acceleration of inclusive economic growth;

* Reinforcement of local content policies;

* Control of inflation;

* Currency stabilization   improvement in levels of international reserves through sustainable export-led policies;

* Reduction in  Debt-to-GDP ratio through further enhancement of our debt-management policies; and

Staple Crops

The NDC Government will launch a "Green Revolution" aimed at doubling  output of staple crops, particularly grains   tubers by 2025. This will guarantee food security    a growing population as well as provide  raw material base    implementing our agroindustrial strategy. Within  period, Ghana should become a net exporter of rice   maize, as well as become self-sufficient in poultry, sugar   tomato production.

The goal will be driven by:

* Facilitating  acquisition of land banks to support commercial agriculture activities;

* Introducing high-yielding, disease-resistant seeds through support    seed production companies;

Cash Crops:

Cocoa Generating about 25% of total export earnings   providing employment    about 800,000 small-holder farmers, cocoa production offers opportunities to increase export earnings by moving up  value chain into intermediate processing   increasing export volumes by improving yields.
The NDC'S record in annual volumes of cocoa produced over  past fifteen years is unparalleled.
Currently, our yield is about 0.5 tonnes per hectare. Less than 25% of cocoa beans      processed locally, allowing Ghana to capture only about 5% of  US$28 billion global intermediate cocoa processing industry.
Over  next four years, we will:

* Adopt  plantation model under PPP arrangements to increase cocoa production     750,000 tonnes to over 1.5 million tonnes by 2025;

IMPACT OF CYBER SPACE ON NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

Like other countries, Ghana is increasingly reliant on Information   Communication Technology (ICT)     progress of  nation. By exploiting  advantages created by automation, networked computers   digital communication  economy       been stimulated   growth enhanced.
Management of  national electricity grid benefits     ICT, election results      efficiently transmitted, a national database of biometric records of citizens       been developed    banking sector utilizes ICT to improve  efficiency of payment systems.
However even as ICT opens up access   simplifies information management, criminal elements continue to probe  systems to identify weaknesses that can be exploited.
Protecting our national systems     criminal intrusion, what is called cyber security,       become  most critical national security objective in  near future.
There      significant exposure risks in  use of  internet, such as when Government officials transmit confidential information utilizing insecure or unprotected private networks. But by far  most critical need is how to secure our sensitive information   databases     cyber-attacks.
The cyber security objective is to safeguard  integrity of our ICT infrastructure by eliminating
* Hacking, which is  unauthorized entry   exploitation of  information in databases;
* Mobile phone fraud;
* Financial fraud (Sakawa)   money laundering;
*  use of our ICT assets to promote terrorist activities.

The NDC intends to implement a national cyber security policy   strategy to secure  data in Ghana's networks   help protect sensitive Government data, including information about individuals.
Governments      unable to fully regulate activities over  internet because it does not occur in  physical environment, which is easy to control in  nation-state. In Ghana, this weakness is compounded by weak   uncoordinated responses to threats to  national information infrastructure.
The pace of technology development       left many national institutions with technical capacity deficits. Law enforcement in particular is vulnerable   is under pressure to respond, but is yet to be adequately equipped with tools   technical capacity to manage  specialized cases emerging.
The next NDC administration plans to confront four critical tasks:
* Improve  awareness of  risks confronting  country;
* Create  capacity to develop   manage  structures needed to combat cyber-crime;
* Enhance international cooperation by establishing a network with key partners in  global cyber security system;
* Establish an elite national cyber security unit to coordinate cyber security operations, harness existing skills   facilities   develop an operational plan to combat  threats that will be identified.
